# simple battery bar script for i3blocks
# the bar itself if made up of 5 unicode squares which become hollow of filled
# depending on the status of the battery.
# there are also colors that correspond with the status of the battery:

# red = your battery is less than 20% full, go charge it before you let it die :(
# orange = your battery is less than 40% full, you should start looking for a charger
# yellow = your battery is less than 60% full, just a friendly reminder that you have a battery
# white = your battey is less than 90% full, it is happy now 
# green = you are either charging your battery or it is above 90% full, good job :)

# and each color corresponds with a number of squares
# red = 1
# orange = 2
# yellow = 3
# white = 4 or 5
# green = 1-5
